  abstract = {We investigated differences in the statistical power to assign parentage between an artificially propagated and wild salmon population. The propagated fish were derived from the wild population and are used to supplement its abundance. Levels of genetic variation were similar between the propagated and wild groups at 11 microsatellite loci, and exclusion probabilities were .0.999999 for both groups. The ability to unambiguously identify a pair of parents for each sampled progeny was much lower than expected, however. Simulations demonstrated that the proportion of cases in which the most likely pair of parents were the true parents was lower for propagated parents than for wild parents. There was a clear relationship between parentage assignment ability and the estimated effective number of grandparents of the progeny to be assigned. If a stringent threshold for parentage assignment was used, estimates of relative fitness were biased downward for the propagated fish. The bias appeared to be largely eliminated by either fractionally assigning progeny among parents in proportion to their likelihood of parentage or by assigning progeny to the most likely set of parents without using a statistical threshold.},

The risk is particularly acute for species that are captively bred and released on a large scale, as is the case for many species of fish. Several studies, particularly in salmonids, have reported rapid adaptation of populations to captivity, but the mechanisms of such adaptations are not always clear. We evaluated a large three-generation pedigree of an artificially supplemented salmon population, and found that the fish with the highest reproductive success in captivity produce early maturing male offspring that have lower than average reproductive success in the wild. In contrast to an earlier study of steelhead trout, we found little evidence that parental origin of the captive spawners influenced the subsequent reproductive success of their naturally spawning progeny.},

On the basis of analysis of 2248 natural-origin and 11594 hatchery-origin fish, we estimated that the rate of homing to natal tributaries by natural-origin fish ranged from 0\% to 99\% depending on the tributary. Hatchery-origin fish released in one of the five tributaries homed to that tributary at a far lower rate than the natural-origin fish (71\% compared to 96\%). For hatchery-released fish, stray rates based on parentage analysis were consistent with rates estimated using physical tag recoveries. Stray rates among major spawning tributaries were generally higher than stray rates of tagged fish to areas outside of the Wenatchee River watershed. Within the Wenatchee watershed, rates of straying by natural-origin fish were significantly affected by spawning tributary and by parental origin: progeny of naturally spawning hatchery-produced fish strayed at significantly higher rates than progeny whose parents were themselves of natural origin. Notably, none of the 170 offspring that were products of mating by two naturalorigin fish strayed from their natal tributary. Indirect estimates of gene flow based on FST statistics were correlated with but higher than the estimates from the parentage data. Tributary-specific estimates of effective population size were also correlated with the number of spawners in each tributary.},

  abstract = {Spawning is a critical stage in the life history of salmonids. Spawning location has been reported to be a significant factor in the fitness differences between natural- and hatchery-origin (natural and hatchery, respectively) female spring Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, although the mechanisms responsible remain uncertain. The objectives of this study were to compare the spawning distributions of hatchery and natural female spring Chinook salmon within the Chiwawa River, Washington, and determine whether spawning characteristics differ between hatchery and natural female Chinook Salmon or between channel types within the Chiwawa River. Over a 10-year period, locations of female carcasses were examined to assess differences in the spawning distribution of hatchery and natural females. Additionally, a suite of metrics was measured from redds of known origin females to characterize the spawning location and redd characteristics. A greater proportion of hatchery females spawned in the lower watershed within plane-bed channels than spawned upstream. Conversely, the majority of natural females spawned farther upstream in pool-riffle channels. The distribution of hatchery fish was presumably strongly influenced by the hatchery acclimation--release location in the lower river. Given the geomorphic characteristics of plane-bed channels, salmon were unable to build redds there similar to those in more typical pool-riffle channels. Redds constructed in plane-bed channels were smaller, shallower, and closer to stream banks than redds in pool-riffle channels. Limited differences were detected in redd characteristics between natural and hatchery females in pool-riffle channels. Smaller hatchery females constructed smaller redds with lower tailspill relief than did larger natural fish. As the results of differences in spawning distribution and fish size, redds constructed by hatchery females were more susceptible to environmental sources of mortality than were redds constructed by natural females. This study provides insight into the possible mechanisms responsible for the reported lower reproductive success among hatchery females spawning in the natural environment.},

  abstract = {While the goal of supplementation programs is to provide positive, population-level effects for species of conservation concern, these programs can also present an inherent fitness risk when captive-born individuals are fully integrated into the natural population. In order to evaluate the long-term effects of a supplementation program and estimate the demographic and phenotypic factors influencing the fitness of a threatened population of Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), we genotyped tissue samples spanning a 19-year period (1998--2016) to generate pedigrees from adult fish returning to Johnson Creek, Idaho, USA. We expanded upon previous estimates of relative reproductive success (RRS) to include grandparentage analyses and used generalized linear models to determine whether origin (hatchery or natural) or phenotypic traits (timing of arrival to spawning grounds, body length, and age) significantly predicted reproductive success (RS) across multiple years. Our results provide evidence that this supplementation program with 100\% natural-origin broodstock provided a long-term demographic boost to the population (mean of 4.56 times in the first generation and mean of 2.52 times in the second generation). Overall, when spawning in nature, hatchery-origin fish demonstrated a trend toward lower RS compared to natural-origin fish (p {$<$} 0.05). However, when hatchery-origin fish successfully spawned with natural-origin fish, they had similar RS compared to natural by natural crosses (first-generation mean hatchery by natural cross RRS = 1.11 females, 1.13 males; second-generation mean hatchery by natural cross RRS = 1.03 females, 1.08 males). While origin, return year, and body length were significant predictors of fitness for both males and females (p {$<$} 0.05), return day was significant for males but not females (p {$>$} 0.05). These results indicate that supplementation programs that reduce the potential for genetic adaptation to captivity can be effective at increasing population abundance while limiting long-term fitness effects on wild populations.},

However, studies have provided evidence that captive breeding can result in domestication, demonstrated by lower fitness of hatchery-origin compared with natural-origin fish. Supplementation programs, therefore, typically use natural-origin broodstock in an effort to minimize long-term negative fitness impacts. Here we evaluated the upper Yakima River spring supplementation program for Chinook Salmon               Oncorhynchus tshawytscha               , which has broodstock comprised exclusively of unmarked fish presumed to be of natural-origin. Using 5\,years of spawner data, we tested for effects of hatchery breeding and rearing on total adult returns and their individual reproductive success when spawning naturally. Our study revealed that supplementation increased overall abundance of fish spawning naturally on the spawning grounds. However, on average, compared with natural-origin spawners, hatchery-origin fish had reduced reproductive success, which also translated to reduced reproductive success in three out of five return years for natural-origin fish that spawned with hatchery-origin fish. As expected, body length and return timing were also significant predictors of reproductive success. However, more generations of data are needed to establish the extent to which reduced reproductive success is passed on to naturally produced progeny.},

  abstract = {Redd abundance and the demographic characteristics of salmon carcasses are frequently used (in combination) to estimate the abundance and characteristics of populations of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. However, there is uncertainty about the quality of these estimates because they rely on untested assumptions. We evaluated the quality of spawning ground estimates of Wenatchee spring Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha by comparing the number and origin of fish migrating upstream of Tumwater Dam with estimates of (1) redd abundance and (2) spawner abundance partitioned by sex and origin. Redd counts were well correlated with the abundance of fish passing Tumwater Dam (r2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.84) between 1999 and 2007, indicating that such counts are a suitable index of population abundance. However, between 2004 and 2007, when carcass data were used to partition escapement estimates, the abundance of hatchery spring Chinook salmon was underestimated (mean {$\frac{1}{4}$} 6\%, range 0--19\%) and that of naturally produced fish was overestimated (mean {$\frac{1}{4}$} 19\%, range {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1--43\%). In addition, male spring Chinook salmon were underestimated by 20\% (range {$\frac{1}{4}$} 18--22\%) and females were overestimated by 32\% (range {$\frac{1}{4}$} 15--65\%). These biases were related to sizerelated carcass recovery bias and differences in the sex ratio between fish of different origins. The length of male spring Chinook salmon was significant in explaining the variation in the probability of carcass recovery but that of females was not. The sex ratios of carcasses adjusted for recovery bias were not significantly different from that for the population measured at Tumwater Dam. Spawning escapement estimates based on uncorrected carcass data underestimated those based on corrected carcass data 13--39\%. We conclude that data collected during spawning ground surveys can be used to estimate the abundance and composition by origin of the spawning population if the biases in carcass recovery data are corrected.},

In most cases, steelhead redd abundances using raw redd counts were underestimated. Mean annual rates of observer efficiency ranged from 0.44 to 0.57, and observer accuracy ranged from 0.67 to 0.83. Regardless of the observer error model used, adjusted annual redd abundance estimates were generally unbiased (range 1.6--0.6 redds). A Gaussian area-under-the-curve methodology that incorporates redd count data and observer error rates was used to generate unbiased estimates of steelhead redd abundance in the Wenatchee (170 redds, coefficient of variation (CV) = 44\%) and Methow (106 redds, CV = 41\%) rivers. Unbiased estimates of redd abundance will help inform new population viability analyses to better prioritize those populations with the greatest conservation need.},

However, for extirpated populations, reintroduction typically requires use of hatchery stocks. We evaluated this strategy by monitoring the naturalization of spring Chinook salmon reintroduced to Lookingglass Creek, OR (Grande Ronde Basin), from a captive brood, hatchery stock. We compared the reproductive success (RS) of naturally spawning natural-origin relative (NOR) to hatchery-origin (HOR) adults across 9 brood years. Individual RS (the number of progeny produced) was estimated by pedigree reconstruction analyses, and then analyzed by generalized linear models to estimate the effect of parental origin, while controlling for potentially confounding covariates. When evaluating RS by juvenile progeny, NOR spawners were more likely to be reproductively successful, and when successful, produced more progeny on average than successful HOR counterparts. We found a similar advantage when evaluating RS by adult progeny, although the origin effect was not as important among successful spawners. Results suggest fish reintroduced from a hatchery stock possess the adaptive capacity to positively contribute to natural productivity and recovery goals.},

In an effort to assess the efficacy of restoration actions, and in order to improve monitoring of species of concern, managers have turned to PIT (passive integrated transponder) tag studies with in-stream detectors to monitor movements of tagged individuals throughout river networks. However, quantifying movements in a river network using PIT tag data with incomplete coverage and imperfect detections presents a challenge. We propose a flexible Bayesian analytic framework that models the imperfectly detected movements of tagged individuals in a nested PIT tag array river network. This model structure provides probabilistic estimates of up-stream migration routes for each tagged individual based on a set of underlying nested state variables. These movement estimates can be converted into abundance estimates when an estimate of abundance is available for a location within the river network. We apply the model framework to data from steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the Upper Columbia River basin and evaluate model performance (precision/variance of simulated population sizes) as a function of population tagging rates and PIT tag array detection probability densities within the river system using a simulation framework. This simulation framework provides both model validation (precision) and the ability to evaluate expected performance improvements (variance) due to changes in tagging rates or PIT receiver array configuration. We also investigate the impact of different network configurations on model estimates. Results from such investigations can help inform decisions regarding future monitoring and management.},

Size and age had a large influence on male fitness, with larger and older males producing more offspring than smaller or younger individuals. Size had a significant effect on female fitness, but the effect was smaller than on male fitness. For both sexes, run time had a smaller but still significant effect on fitness, with earlier returning fish favored. Spawning location within the river had a significant effect on fitness for both sexes. Hatchery-origin fish produced about half the juvenile progeny per parent when spawning naturally than did natural-origin fish. Hatchery fish tended to be younger and return to lower areas of the watershed than wild fish, which explained some of their lower fitness.},
