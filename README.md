This repository contains the data and code for running the **D**am
**A**dult **B**ranch **O**ccupancy **M**odel
([DABOM](https://github.com/KevinSee/DABOM)) for adult steelhead
returning above Priest Rapids Dam in the Upper Columbia River. This
model estimates escapement past various locations in the Upper Columbia
using detections of PIT tagged fish. The full methods are described in
the paper:

> Waterhouse, L., White, J., See, K.E., Murdoch, A. R. and Semmens,
> B.X., (2020). *A Bayesian nested patch occupancy model to estimate
> steelhead movement and abundance*. Ecological Applications
> <https://doi.org/xxx/xxx>

The most recent estimates for various spawn years can be found in the
“outgoing/estimates” folder that is available after cloning or
downloading this compendium. There is a manual describing the
step-by-step instructions to generate these results, found in the
“analysis/paper” folder.
